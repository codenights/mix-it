# API reference

Make reading and writing API reference a breathe!

## Editing

You may use [StopLight Studio](https://stoplight.io/studio/) to design the API.
It is available as a web app or as a downloadable app on major platforms.
It accelerates the design flow by providing an easy-to-use UI, which generates
the OpenAPI spec under the hood. It makes the design step faster, funnier and
less bug prone.

To change the API reference:
- Open `mix-it-api.v1.yaml` in an editor (StopLight Studio or whatever it is)
- Edit and save changes
- Push, done!

The CI will deploy these changes on the **master** branch.
